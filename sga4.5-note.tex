\section*{Typesetters note}

This is a \LaTeX rendition of Deligne's \emph{Cohomologie \'Etale}, Lecture 
Notes in Mathematics, 569, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York. The 
typesetting was done by Daniel Miller. The source code may be found at 
GitHub (\url{https://www.github.com/dkmiller/sga4.5}). It is an essentially 
unmodified version of the original. The only changes are slight, e.g. using 
script instead of roman letters for sheaves. Any comments or corrections should 
be sent to \url{dkmiller@math.cornell.edu}.
